## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lukas Cizek â€” a senior full-stack engineer with a strong frontend focus, specializing in React, TypeScript, and building fast, accessible, and scalable web apps. I also bring solid backend experience with Node.js, Java, and Go.

With 10 years in the industry, Iâ€™ve led teams, mentored developers, and shipped products used by millions â€” from rapid prototypes to complex enterprise systems.
Open to remote opportunities (contract or full-time).

ðŸ“Œ Selected projects (open PRs available for context):
- [sportujspolu](https://github.com/GLObus303/sportujspolu) â€” built with a collaborator; I mainly contribute through code reviews and technical guidance.
- [sportujspolu-be](https://github.com/GLObus303/sportujspolu-be) â€” Go backend I used to explore and learn Go.
- [buk-klab](https://github.com/eliskavo/buk-klab) â€” mentoring project created as part of the [ReactGirls](https://reactgirls.com/) program.
