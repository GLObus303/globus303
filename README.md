## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lukas Cizek â€” a senior front-end engineer focused on React, TypeScript, and building fast, accessible, and scalable web apps.

Iâ€™ve led teams, mentored developers, and shipped products used by millions.  
Open to remote opportunities (contract or full-time).

ðŸ“Œ Selected projects (open PRs available for context):
- [sportujspolu](https://github.com/GLObus303/sportujspolu) â€” built with a collaborator; I mainly contribute through code reviews and technical guidance.
- [sportujspolu-be](https://github.com/GLObus303/sportujspolu-be) â€” Go backend I used to explore and learn Go.
- [buk-klab](https://github.com/eliskavo/buk-klab) â€” mentoring project created as part of the [ReactGirls](https://reactgirls.com/) program.
